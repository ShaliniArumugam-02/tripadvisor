ðŸ§³ TripAdvisor Clone (HTML & CSS Only)
This is a simple clone of the TripAdvisor homepage that I built using just HTML and CSS. It's a front-end-only project meant to replicate the layout and design of the original site as closely as possible.

I made this to practice my HTML/CSS skills and work on building responsive, clean UI layouts without using any frameworks or JavaScript.

âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Included
A responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile

Navigation bar with logo and search section

Hero/banner section with a call to action

Card-style sections for destinations, hotels, restaurants, etc.

A footer with useful links and social icons

Clean, well-organized code using modern CSS (Flexbox & Grid)

ðŸ”§ Tech Used
HTML5

CSS3

Google Fonts
